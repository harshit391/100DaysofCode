// Leetcode Problem 912

// Sort an Array

// Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

// You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
// Output: [1,2,3,5]
// Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
